# UFOs
## Project Overview
The main purpose of this project was to build a webpage and a dynamic table to research UFO sightings from a pool of sightings. The website created allows filterations in multiple criterias at the same time, and additionally, the website adds filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
To utilize the webpage, one can use the filterbars shown on the image below. The image samples a sighting from the state of CA with the date of "1/1/2010". The website is unique in the fact that it can be filtered either using one search criteria or all search criterias at the same time

## Summary
The website is not quite user friendly due to the layout. The filter table is tucked to the edge of the webpage which makes it less intuitive. Secondly, the webpage does not allow users to save or download their searches. In order to improve the website, it would be helpful to add a download feature and to also create an interactive portion where users can share their information with fellow users to develop deeper relationships with other enthusiasts.
